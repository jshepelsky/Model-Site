        <p>I’m Natalie Entenberg- born in Brooklyn and raised in Pennsylvania, I’ve walked the concrete and I’ve climbed the mountains. Art has always been my form of self expression, whether that means making dirt soup in my backyard as a little girl or walking across a stage with a story to tell. Film too.</p>
